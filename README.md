# Singapore Travel Itinerary Optimizer

# üîé Problem
Travel planning can be extremely overwhelming. When planning a trip, travelers often struggle with:
- Finding the best itinerary that balances cost, time, and enjoyment.
- Managing different types of activities (food, attractions, tours) within a given time frame.
- ... while also minimizing unnecessary travel time between locations.

There are travel planning tools out there, but tend to lack customized itinerary optimization that adapts to the traveler‚Äôs specific constraints.

# üí° Solution

Our Travel Optimizer uses Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to generate an optimized travel schedule.

Our optimization model aims to (in order of priority): 
- Minimize travel time: Using Google Maps API, the optimizer ensures efficient route planning.
- Maximize overall satisfaction: The final itinerary balances cost and enjoyment scores.

While also considering:
- Constraints on budget, time windows, travel duration, and enjoyment scores.
- Variety of activities where food, tours, and attractions are optimally distributed throughout the itinerary.
